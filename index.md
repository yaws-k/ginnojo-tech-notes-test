# Ginnojo Tech Notes

A collection of technical notes and guides on setting up and managing a multi-purpose server (web, database, mail, and various software applications) using Debian Linux.

Everything is set up on the same server for simplicity and ease of management. For heavy-duty production environments, consider using separate servers for each service.

## Debian versions

The guides are based on Debian 13 (Trixie), the latest stable release. If you need the older Debian 12 (Bookworm) version, please refer to the [Debian 12 (Bookworm) section](/12/).
